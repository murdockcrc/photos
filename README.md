# Welcome

This repository is a historical archive of my personal photos.

# Usage

All material published in this repository is subject the license conditions described [HERE](/LICENSE). In the license, the term "Software" must be broadly understood as including the creative works published in this repository (Intellectual Property). The most important part for me to select the MIT license  to publish this work is the attribution part.

# Why GitHub

There are many websites dedicated to publishing photography work, much more functional for that purpose than GitHub. However, I want to host my work on a place that will out live myself. The problem with all those photo websites is, once you depart from this life (and thus stop payments to the provider), your site and your work will go offline with you. With this repository, I am assuming that GitHub and its content will stay around for decades to come.
