## Zurich
### 2022-04-13

This is a spot I pass through almost every day. It is a bike / pedestrian path, close to the town of Bassersdorf. Far from homes or commercial buildings, this spot is rather secluded. Graffitti is not popular in Switzerland, but at places like this, street artists can exercise their art without creating (too much) problems with the authorities.

What makes this place special is the lighting during sunrise. At this time of the day, and in the absence of clouds, the warm color temperature of the sunrise light gives a special effect to this street art. I had to wait for weeks for the lighting conditions to be appropriate before I could take these images.
