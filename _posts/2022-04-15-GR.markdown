### 2022-04-15

The Rätikon mountain range lies to the north of the Prättigau valley in canton Graubünden, Swtizerland. On this day, I took out my road bike (for the first time since the end of autumn 2021) and took up the 12km climb up to St. Antönien.

| <b>Looks like autumn, but this is actually spring</b><br/>With the snow just recently melted, the floor of the forest uncovers all the dead leaves that fell from the trees back in autumn. The leaves are surprisingly very well preserved, despite them being dead for months already.|
