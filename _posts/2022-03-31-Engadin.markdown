For the second time in its lifetime, my company organized a workation at the MiaEngiadina co-working in Lapunt, Graubunden.

Going up to the Engadin valley at the end of March is like a trip back into the winter. Whereas the valley in Switzerland is already enjoying warmer spring temperatures, in Lapunt we found snowy weather and freezing-cold days.
